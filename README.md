# University-Analysis

Project Summary:

The project conducted thorough analyses on university rankings, employing SQL, Excel, and Power BI. Data sourced from GitHub underwent rigorous cleaning to ensure accuracy, followed by a MECE analysis for systematic examination. Integration with MySQL and Power BI facilitated efficient data management and visualization, enabling the creation of insightful dashboards covering various aspects such as university, ranking, country, and yearly analyses.

The university dashboard provided detailed insights into individual universities and their metrics, while the ranking dashboard facilitated comparisons across different ranking systems and assessed the impact of ranking criteria. Furthermore, the country dashboard offered valuable insights into the distribution of universities across different countries, while the yearly analysis dashboard tracked changes in university metrics over time.

Exploratory SQL analysis revealed significant trends, while Power BI visualizations addressed key questions related to international student enrollment, ranking criteria comparison, and university metrics evolution. Comprehensive documentation was maintained to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the analyses conducted, enhancing the project's reliability and usefulness.
